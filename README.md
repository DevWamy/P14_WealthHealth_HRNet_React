## Frontend

### General information

Here is a proposal for updating and converting to React the internal web application that manages employee files.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS < v.16](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM (**version 8.15.0**)](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [REACT (**version 18.2.0**)](https://en.reactjs.org/) 
- [VSCODE (**version 1.73.1**)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

If you are working with several versions of NodeJS, we recommend you install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). This tool will allow you to easily manage your NodeJS versions.


- Run the `yarn` or `npm` command will allow you to install the dependencies

### Project setup

- Fork and clone the repository on your computer.

````bash
git clone https://github.com/DevWamy/P14_WealthHealth_HRNet_React.git
````

- Package installations after cloning.

```bash
# with NPM
npm install
# with Yarn
yarn
```

- Start the application
 
For frontEnd :
open a new terminal, then run the `npm start` or `yarn start ` with Yarn .

It will allow you to run the application on http://localhost:3000
